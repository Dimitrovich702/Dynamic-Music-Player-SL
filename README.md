# Dynamic Music Player for Second Life

This project is a script for a dynamic music player in Second Life. It allows you to play sound clips from a notecard with proper synchronization, regardless of the length of the song.

## Features

- Plays sound clips from a notecard
- Supports varying clip lengths specified in the notecard
- Can be used to create and sell your own products under the MIT license
- Reselling the script without modification is not allowed

## Usage

1. Copy and paste the Dynamic Music Player script into your Second Life object.
2. Drop a notecard with your song UUIDs and clip lengths into the object.
3. Enjoy the synchronized playback of your music clips!

## Notecard Format

The notecard should follow the float length of the clip on the first line, followed by the UUIDs of the songs. Each line represents a separate clip.

Example:
```
