# Dynamic Music Player for Second Life

This project is a script for a dynamic music player in Second Life. It allows you to play sound clips from a notecard with proper synchronization, regardless of the length of the song.

## Features

- Plays sound clips from several notecards
- Supports varying clip lengths specified in the notecard
- Can be used to create and sell your own products under the MIT license
- Reselling the script without modification is not allowed

## Usage

1. Copy and paste the Dynamic Music Player script into your Second Life object.
2. Drop a notecard with your song UUIDs and clip lengths into the object.
3. Enjoy the synchronized playback of your music clips!

## Notecard Format
Notecards no longer need format in the newer versions cause of the formalization.
The notecard should follow the float length of the clip on the first line, followed by the UUIDs of the songs. Each line represents a separate clip.

Example:
```
